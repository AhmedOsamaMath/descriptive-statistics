# Sampling Techniques

Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals, items, or observations from a larger population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. It is a fundamental aspect of statistical analysis, enabling efficient data collection and analysis.

## Why Use Sampling?

1. **Efficiency**: Collecting data from an entire population can be time-consuming and expensive.  
2. **Feasibility**: In some cases, it is impossible to study the whole population (e.g., testing every product).  
3. **Accuracy**: Well-designed samples provide accurate estimates of population characteristics.

## Types of Sampling Techniques

Sampling methods are broadly classified into **probability sampling** and **non-probability sampling**.

---

### 1. **Probability Sampling**

In probability sampling, every member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected. This method reduces bias and allows for generalization to the entire population.

#### 1.1. Simple Random Sampling

- **Description**: Each individual has an equal chance of being selected.  
- **Method**: Use random numbers or draw names from a hat.  
- **Example**: Selecting 100 students randomly from a school.  

#### 1.2. Stratified Sampling

- **Description**: The population is divided into strata (subgroups) based on shared characteristics, and a random sample is taken from each stratum.  
- **Example**: Sampling students by grade level (e.g., 10th, 11th, 12th grades).  

#### 1.3. Systematic Sampling

- **Description**: Every $k$-th individual is selected from a list, starting at a random point.
- **Example**: Selecting every 10th person from a customer database.

#### 1.4. Cluster Sampling

- **Description**: The population is divided into clusters, and entire clusters are randomly selected for sampling.  
- **Example**: Sampling all households in randomly selected neighborhoods.  

#### 1.5. Multistage Sampling

- **Description**: Combines multiple probability sampling methods.  
- **Example**: First selecting clusters, then randomly sampling individuals within those clusters.

### 2. **Non-Probability Sampling**

In non-probability sampling, individuals are selected based on non-random criteria, making it less representative of the entire population.

#### 2.1. Convenience Sampling

- **Description**: Selecting individuals who are easiest to reach.  
- **Example**: Surveying people in a shopping mall.  

#### 2.2. Judgmental (or Purposive) Sampling

- **Description**: The researcher selects participants based on their expertise or knowledge.  
- **Example**: Selecting experienced managers to evaluate a training program.  

#### 2.3. Snowball Sampling

- **Description**: Participants recruit other participants, forming a chain.  
- **Example**: Surveying members of a niche community.  

#### 2.4. Quota Sampling

- **Description**: Selecting individuals to meet predefined quotas for subgroups.  
- **Example**: Ensuring equal numbers of men and women in a sample.

| **Use Case**           | Generalizable studies (e.g., population surveys) | Exploratory research (e.g., pilot studies) |

## How to Choose a Sampling Technique?

1. **Purpose of Study**: Use probability sampling for generalizable studies and non-probability for exploratory or qualitative research.  
2. **Population Characteristics**: Consider factors like diversity and size of the population.  
3. **Resources**: Time, budget, and manpower may limit the sampling method.

## Applications in Real Life

1. **Market Research**:  
   - Stratified sampling to understand customer preferences by age groups.  

2. **Healthcare Studies**:  
   - Random sampling to test a new drug's effectiveness.  

3. **Social Research**:  
   - Snowball sampling to study hard-to-reach populations like refugees.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right sampling technique is crucial for obtaining reliable and valid results. Probability sampling ensures generalizability, while non-probability sampling is often more practical for specific scenarios.
