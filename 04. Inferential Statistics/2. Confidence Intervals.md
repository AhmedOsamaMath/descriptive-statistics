# Confidence Intervals

A **confidence interval** (CI) is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true population parameter. It provides an estimate of the parameter along with a measure of uncertainty.

---

## Why Use Confidence Intervals?

1. **Precision**: Provides a range rather than a single point estimate, offering more information about the parameter.  
2. **Uncertainty**: Quantifies the level of confidence in the estimate.  
3. **Interpretability**: Helps in decision-making by considering the possible range of values for a parameter.

## Key Components of a Confidence Interval

1. **Point Estimate**: The central value (e.g., sample mean) used as the best estimate of the population parameter.  
2. **Margin of Error**: The maximum expected difference between the point estimate and the true parameter.  
3. **Confidence Level**: The probability that the interval contains the true parameter, typically expressed as a percentage (e.g., 95%).  

### Common Confidence Levels:
- **90% Confidence Level**: Less precise, smaller margin of error.  
- **95% Confidence Level**: Most commonly used.  
- **99% Confidence Level**: More precise, larger margin of error.

## Formula for Confidence Interval

### For a Population Mean (\(\mu\)):  

\[
\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm Z \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]  

Where:  
- \(\bar{x}\): Sample mean  
- \(Z\): Z-score corresponding to the confidence level  
- \(\sigma\): Population standard deviation (or sample standard deviation \(s\) if \(\sigma\) is unknown)  
- \(n\): Sample size  

### For a Population Proportion (\(p\)):  

\[
\text{CI} = \hat{p} \pm Z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
\]  

Where:  
- \(\hat{p}\): Sample proportion  
- \(Z\): Z-score corresponding to the confidence level  
- \(n\): Sample size

## Z-Scores for Common Confidence Levels

| Confidence Level | Z-Score (\(Z\)) |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 90%              | 1.645           |
| 95%              | 1.960           |
| 99%              | 2.576           |

## Example 1: Confidence Interval for a Mean

A sample of 50 students has a mean test score of 75 with a standard deviation of 10. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.

### Solution:
\[
\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm Z \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\]
\[
\text{CI} = 75 \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{10}{\sqrt{50}}
\]
\[
\text{CI} = 75 \pm 1.96 \cdot 1.414 \approx 75 \pm 2.77
\]
\[
\text{CI} = [72.23, 77.77]
\]

The 95% confidence interval for the population mean is \( [72.23, 77.77] \).

## Example 2: Confidence Interval for a Proportion

In a survey of 200 people, 60% said they prefer coffee over tea. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population proportion.

### Solution:
\[
\text{CI} = \hat{p} \pm Z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
\]
\[
\text{CI} = 0.60 \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.60 \cdot 0.40}{200}}
\]
\[
\text{CI} = 0.60 \pm 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{0.0012} \approx 0.60 \pm 1.96 \cdot 0.0346
\]
\[
\text{CI} = 0.60 \pm 0.0679
\]
\[
\text{CI} = [0.532, 0.668]
\]

The 95% confidence interval for the population proportion is \( [0.532, 0.668] \).

## Interpretation of Confidence Intervals

A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take 100 random samples and calculate the CI for each, approximately 95 of them would contain the true population parameter.

**Important Notes**:  
- The CI does not imply that the true parameter has a 95% probability of lying within the interval. The interval either contains the parameter or it doesnâ€™t.  
- Larger sample sizes result in narrower confidence intervals (more precision).  
- Higher confidence levels result in wider confidence intervals (more certainty).

## Applications of Confidence Intervals

1. **Business**: Estimating average customer satisfaction scores.  
2. **Healthcare**: Estimating the effectiveness of a new treatment.  
3. **Polling**: Predicting election outcomes based on survey results.

## Conclusion

Confidence intervals provide a robust method for estimating population parameters with a quantifiable level of uncertainty. Mastering CIs enables better decision-making and clearer communication of statistical findings.
