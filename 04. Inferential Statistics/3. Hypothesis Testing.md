# Hypothesis Testing

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It evaluates whether there is enough evidence to support or reject a specific claim about a population parameter.

## Key Concepts in Hypothesis Testing

1. **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**  
   The default assumption that there is no effect or difference.  
   - Example: $H_0: \mu = 50$ (The population mean is 50).  

2. **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**  
   The statement being tested, representing a potential effect or difference.  
   - Example: $H_a: \mu \neq 50$ (The population mean is not 50).  

3. **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**  
   The threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, typically set at 0.05 (5%).

4. **Test Statistic**  
   A value calculated from the sample data used to compare with the critical value or p-value.

5. **P-Value**  
   The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming $H_0$ is true.  

6. **Decision Rule**  
   - Reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $ \leq \alpha$.  
   - Fail to reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $ > \alpha$.

## Steps in Hypothesis Testing

1. **State the Hypotheses**:  
   - Null hypothesis ($H_0$)  
   - Alternative hypothesis ($H_a$)  

2. **Set the Significance Level ($\alpha$)**:  
   Common values are 0.01, 0.05, or 0.10.  

3. **Choose the Test and Calculate the Test Statistic**:  
   Select the appropriate test (e.g., $t$-test, $z$-test) based on data type and sample size.  

4. **Find the P-Value or Critical Value**:  
   Compare the test statistic to the critical value or use the $p$-value approach.  

5. **Make a Decision**:  
   - Reject $H_0$ if there is sufficient evidence.  
   - Fail to reject $H_0$ if there is insufficient evidence.  

6. **Draw a Conclusion**:  
   State the results in the context of the problem.

## Types of Hypothesis Tests

### 1. **One-Tailed Test**

- Tests if a parameter is **greater than** or **less than** a specific value.  
- Example: $H_0: \mu \leq 50, \, H_a: \mu > 50$  

### 2. **Two-Tailed Test**

- Tests if a parameter is **not equal to** a specific value.  
- Example: $H_0: \mu = 50, \, H_a: \mu \neq 50$

## Common Tests in Hypothesis Testing

1. **Z-Test**  
   - Used for large sample sizes ($n > 30$) or when population variance is known.  
   - Example: Testing if the mean height of students differs from 170 cm.  

2. **T-Test**  
   - Used for small sample sizes ($n \leq 30$) or when population variance is unknown.  
   - Types: One-sample $t$-test, two-sample $t$-test, paired $t$-test.  

3. **Chi-Square Test**  
   - Used for categorical data to test relationships or goodness of fit.  
   - Example: Testing if the observed frequencies of colors in candy bags match the expected proportions.  

4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**  
   - Used to compare means across three or more groups.  
   - Example: Testing if the average test scores differ across schools.

## Example: One-Sample T-Test

### Problem:

A company claims the average lifetime of its batteries is 300 hours. A random sample of 25 batteries has a mean lifetime of 290 hours with a standard deviation of 20 hours. Is there evidence at the 0.05 significance level to reject the companyâ€™s claim?

### Solution:

1. **State the Hypotheses**:  
   $H_0: \mu = 300$, $H_a: \mu \neq 300$

2. **Set the Significance Level**:  
   $\alpha = 0.05$

3. **Calculate the Test Statistic**:

   $$t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{290 - 300}{\frac{20}{\sqrt{25}}} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5$$

4. **Find the Critical Value or P-Value**:  
   From $t$-distribution tables, critical $t$-value at $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed, $df = 24$) is approximately $\pm 2.064$.  

5. **Decision**:  
   Since $-2.5 < -2.064$, reject $H_0$.

6. **Conclusion**:  
   There is sufficient evidence to reject the claim that the average battery lifetime is 300 hours.

## Applications of Hypothesis Testing

1. **Healthcare**: Testing the effectiveness of new treatments.  
2. **Business**: Comparing customer satisfaction between two products.  
3. **Education**: Evaluating the impact of new teaching methods.

## Conclusion

Hypothesis testing is a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions. By systematically evaluating claims and interpreting results, it enables researchers and decision-makers to draw reliable conclusions.
