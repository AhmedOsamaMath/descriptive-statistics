# Rules of Probability

Probability rules are fundamental principles that govern how probabilities are calculated and combined. These rules allow us to analyze complex events and make predictions in uncertain scenarios.

## 1. **Addition Rule**

The addition rule is used to calculate the probability of the union of two events (i.e., either event $A$ or event $B$, or both occurring).

### Formula:  

For two events $A$ and $B$:  

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

### Special Cases:  

- **Mutually Exclusive Events**:  
  If $A$ and $B$ cannot occur simultaneously ($P(A \cap B) = 0$):  

  $$
  P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
  $$

### Example:  

A card is drawn from a deck. What is the probability of drawing a King or a Heart?

- $P(\text{King}) = \frac{4}{52}$
- $P(\text{Heart}) = \frac{13}{52}$
- $P(\text{King} \cap \text{Heart}) = \frac{1}{52}$ (King of Hearts)  

$$
P(\text{King} \cup \text{Heart}) = \frac{4}{52} + \frac{13}{52} - \frac{1}{52} = \frac{16}{52} = \frac{4}{13}
$$

## 2. **Multiplication Rule**

The multiplication rule is used to calculate the probability of the intersection of two events (i.e., both event $A$ and event $B$ occurring).

### Formula:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B \mid A)
$$

Where $P(B \mid A)$ is the conditional probability of $B$ given $A$.

### Special Cases:

- **Independent Events**:
  If $A$ and $B$ are independent ($P(B \mid A) = P(B)$):

  $$
  P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
  $$

### Example:  

Tossing two coins. What is the probability of getting heads on both coins?

- $P(\text{Heads on 1st coin}) = \frac{1}{2}$
- $P(\text{Heads on 2nd coin}) = \frac{1}{2}$

$$
P(\text{Both Heads}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

## 3. **Complement Rule**

The complement rule calculates the probability of an event not occurring.

### Formula:  

$$
P(\text{Not A}) = 1 - P(A)
$$

### Example:  

What is the probability of not rolling a 6 on a fair die?  

$$
P(\text{Not 6}) = 1 - P(6) = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
$$

## 4. **Conditional Probability**

Conditional probability calculates the probability of an event $B$ given that another event $A$ has occurred.

### Formula:

$$
P(B \mid A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
$$

Provided $P(A) > 0 $.

### Example:

A card is drawn from a deck. What is the probability that it is a King given it is a Heart?

- $P(\text{King} \cap \text{Heart}) = \frac{1}{52}$
- $P(\text{Heart}) = \frac{13}{52}$

$$
P(\text{King} \mid \text{Heart}) = \frac{P(\text{King} \cap \text{Heart})}{P(\text{Heart})} = \frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{13}{52}} = \frac{1}{13}
$$
