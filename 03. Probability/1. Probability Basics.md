# Probability Basics

Probability is the branch of mathematics that measures the likelihood of an event occurring. It provides a foundation for statistical analysis and decision-making under uncertainty.

## What is Probability?

Probability quantifies uncertainty, representing it as a number between 0 and 1:

- **0**: The event will not happen (impossible).  
- **1**: The event will certainly happen.  

### Formula:

The probability of an event $A$ is given by:

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

## Key Terminology

1. **Experiment**:
   An action or process with uncertain outcomes.  
   Example: Tossing a coin.

2. **Sample Space ($S$)**:
   The set of all possible outcomes.  
   Example: For a coin toss, $S = \{ \text{Heads, Tails} \}$.

3. **Event**:
   A subset of the sample space representing a specific outcome or combination of outcomes.  
   Example: Getting heads in a coin toss.

4. **Favorable Outcome**:
   The specific outcome(s) of interest in an event.  
   Example: Rolling a 6 on a die.

## Types of Probability

### 1. **Theoretical Probability**

Based on logical analysis without actual experiments.  

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}
$$

**Example**: The probability of rolling a 4 on a fair die is:  

$$
P(4) = \frac{1}{6}
$$

### 2. **Experimental Probability**  

Based on the results of experiments or observations.  

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of times event occurs}}{\text{Total number of trials}}
$$

**Example**: If a coin lands on heads 7 times in 10 tosses, the probability of heads is:

$$
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{7}{10}
$$

### 3. **Subjective Probability**

Based on intuition, personal judgment, or experience.

**Example**: Estimating the probability of rain tomorrow based on current weather patterns.

## Properties of Probability

1. **Range**:
   Probability always lies between 0 and 1:  
   
   $$0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$$

2. **Sum of Probabilities**:  
   
   The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes equals 1:  
   
   $$\sum P(A_i) = 1$$

3. **Complement Rule**:  
   The probability of an event not happening is:  
   
   $$P(\text{Not A}) = 1 - P(A)$$

   **Example**: If $P(A) = 0.7$, then $P(\text{Not A}) = 0.3$.

## Common Applications of Probability

1. **Games of Chance**:  
   - Calculating odds in card games or dice rolls.

2. **Weather Forecasting**:  
   - Predicting the likelihood of rain or snow.

3. **Finance**:  
   - Assessing investment risks and returns.

4. **Healthcare**:  
   - Estimating the effectiveness of a new drug in clinical trials.

## Example Problems

### Problem 1: Tossing a Coin

What is the probability of getting heads in a single coin toss?  
**Solution**:

$$
P(\text{Heads}) = \frac{\text{Favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

### Problem 2: Rolling a Die  

What is the probability of rolling an even number on a fair six-sided die?  
**Solution**:
Favorable outcomes = $\{2, 4, 6\}$

$$
P(\text{Even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

## Conclusion

Probability forms the foundation for understanding randomness and uncertainty. By learning its basics, you can analyze real-world situations, make predictions, and make informed decisions.
