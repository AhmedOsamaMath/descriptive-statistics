# Discrete and Continuous Distributions

Probability distributions describe how the values of a random variable are distributed. These distributions are categorized into **discrete** and **continuous**, depending on the nature of the random variable.

## 1. **Discrete Distributions**

Discrete distributions describe the probabilities of outcomes for a **discrete random variable**, which takes on a countable number of values.

### Characteristics:
- The probabilities of all possible outcomes add up to 1.  
- Examples of discrete random variables: Number of heads in coin tosses, number of customers in a queue.

### Common Discrete Distributions:

#### **1.1. Bernoulli Distribution**
- Describes a random experiment with two outcomes: success (\(1\)) and failure (\(0\)).  
- **Example**: Tossing a coin (success = heads, failure = tails).  
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:  
  \[
  P(X = x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x}, \quad x \in \{0, 1\}
  \]  
  Where \(p\) is the probability of success.

#### **1.2. Binomial Distribution**
- Describes the number of successes in \(n\) independent Bernoulli trials.  
- **Example**: Number of heads in 10 coin tosses.  
- **PMF**:  
  \[
  P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}, \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, n
  \]  
  Where:  
  - \(n\): Number of trials  
  - \(p\): Probability of success  

#### **1.3. Poisson Distribution**
- Models the number of events in a fixed interval of time or space.  
- **Example**: Number of customer arrivals at a store in an hour.  
- **PMF**:  
  \[
  P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots
  \]  
  Where \(\lambda\) is the average rate of occurrences.

## 2. **Continuous Distributions**

Continuous distributions describe probabilities for a **continuous random variable**, which can take on an infinite number of values within a range.

### Characteristics:
- Probabilities are represented as areas under a probability density function (PDF).  
- The total area under the PDF equals 1.  
- Examples of continuous random variables: Height, weight, temperature.

### Common Continuous Distributions:

#### **2.1. Uniform Distribution**
- All outcomes in a range \([a, b]\) are equally likely.  
- **Example**: Randomly selecting a number between 0 and 10.  
- **PDF**:  
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b
  \]  

#### **2.2. Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**
- Describes data that clusters around a mean (\(\mu\)), with a spread determined by the standard deviation (\(\sigma\)).  
- **Example**: Heights of people in a population.  
- **PDF**:  
  \[
  f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
  \]  

#### **2.3. Exponential Distribution**
- Models the time between events in a Poisson process.  
- **Example**: Time until the next customer arrives.  
- **PDF**:  
  \[
  f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \geq 0
  \]  
  Where \(\lambda\) is the rate parameter.

## Key Differences Between Discrete and Continuous Distributions

| Feature                  | Discrete Distribution                     | Continuous Distribution                 |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Random Variable**      | Countable values (e.g., 0, 1, 2)         | Infinite values within a range          |
| **Representation**       | PMF (Probability Mass Function)          | PDF (Probability Density Function)      |
| **Examples**             | Binomial, Poisson                       | Normal, Uniform, Exponential            |
| **Probability**          | Exact value has non-zero probability     | Exact value has zero probability (area under curve for range) |

## Applications in Real Life

### Discrete Distributions:
1. **Binomial**: Probability of a specific number of defective items in a batch.  
2. **Poisson**: Modeling call arrivals at a call center.  

### Continuous Distributions:
1. **Normal**: Analyzing test scores in a standardized exam.  
2. **Exponential**: Estimating the time between server requests.

## Conclusion

Understanding discrete and continuous distributions is essential for modeling real-world phenomena and conducting statistical analysis. By selecting the appropriate distribution, you can gain deeper insights into data and make informed predictions.
