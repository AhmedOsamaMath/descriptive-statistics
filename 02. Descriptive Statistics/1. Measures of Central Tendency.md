# Measures of Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency are statistical tools that describe the center or typical value of a dataset. These measures provide a single value that represents the entire dataset, summarizing it effectively.

## 1. **Mean (Arithmetic Average)**

The mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in the dataset.

### Formula:

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}
$$  

Where:

- $x_i$ = Each value in the dataset  
- $n$ = Total number of values  

### Example:

Dataset: $5, 10, 15, 20, 25$  

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + 25}{5} = \frac{75}{5} = 15
$$

**Key Points:**

- Sensitive to outliers (e.g., very high or low values).
- Suitable for quantitative data.

## 2. **Median**

The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

### Steps to Calculate:

1. Arrange the data in order.
2. Identify the middle value(s).

### Example 1 (Odd Number of Values):

Dataset: $3, 7, 8, 12, 15$

$$
\text{Median} = 8
$$

### Example 2 (Even Number of Values):

Dataset: $4, 6, 9, 11$

$$
\text{Median} = \frac{6 + 9}{2} = 7.5
$$

**Key Points:**

- Not affected by outliers.
- Best for ordinal and quantitative data.

## 3. **Mode**

The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have:

- **One mode** (Unimodal)
- **Two modes** (Bimodal)
- **No mode** (All values occur equally)

### Example:

Dataset: $2, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8$  

$$
\text{Mode} = 7
$$

**Key Points:**

- Suitable for categorical, ordinal, and quantitative data.
- May not exist if no value repeats.

## Comparison of Measures

| Measure    | Pros                                              | Cons                                  |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Mean**   | Uses all data values; precise and commonly used   | Affected by outliers                  |
| **Median** | Robust to outliers; represents middle value       | Ignores the full distribution of data |
| **Mode**   | Easy to identify; useful for categorical data     | May not always be unique or exist     |

---

## Choosing the Right Measure

- Use the **mean** when the dataset is evenly distributed without extreme outliers.
- Use the **median** for skewed data or when outliers are present.
- Use the **mode** for identifying the most common value, especially in categorical data.

## Applications in Real Life

1. **Mean**: Calculating the average salary in a company.  
2. **Median**: Determining the median income to analyze the middle class in economics.  
3. **Mode**: Finding the most popular product size or color in a store.

## Conclusion

Measures of central tendency provide a simple yet powerful way to understand the core of a dataset. Choosing the right measure depends on the data type and distribution, ensuring accurate and meaningful analysis.
