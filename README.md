## Introduction

Descriptive statistics comprises methods for organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in an informative way. These techniques help researchers and analysts understand the main features of data collections without necessarily analyzing every single observation.

## Key Concepts

### Fundamental Concepts

- **Population**
  - **Definition**: The complete set of all items, individuals, or measurements of interest for a particular study
  - **Case**: In a study of customer satisfaction at a restaurant chain, the population is all customers who have dined at any location in the past year.
  - **Case**: A researcher studying diabetes in the United States - the population would be all individuals with diabetes in the US.

- **Sample**
  - **Definition**: A subset of the population that is selected for study when it's impractical to examine the entire population
  - **Case**: Surveying 500 randomly selected customers from the restaurant's loyalty program members.
  - **Case**: From the diabetes study - examining 1000 randomly selected diabetic patients from different states.

- **Variable**
  - **Definition**: A characteristic or feature that can vary among the data points
  - **Case**: In the restaurant study: food quality ratings (1-5), wait time (minutes), order total ($), and dining frequency.
  - **Case**: In a student performance study, variables might include test scores, study hours, attendance rate, and gender.

### Measurement Concepts

- **Parameter**
  - **Definition**: A numerical value that describes a characteristic of a population
  - **Case**: The average height of all adult males in a country (μ), not just those measured in a study.
  - **Case**: The true average spending per visit (μ) of ALL customers at the restaurant chain.

  - **Case**: The average height (x̄) calculated from measuring 500 adult males in a particular city.
  - **Case**: The average spending per visit (x̄) calculated from the 500 surveyed customers.

- **Scale of Measurement**
  - **Definition**: The way in which variables are measured and categorized
  - **Case**: Temperature can be measured on nominal (hot/cold), ordinal (hot/warm/cool/cold), interval (Celsius/Fahrenheit), or ratio (Kelvin) scales.
  - **Case**: Customer satisfaction measured on:
    - Nominal: Preferred dining time (lunch/dinner)
    - Ordinal: Service rating (poor/fair/good/excellent)
    - Interval: Temperature preference for food serving
    - Ratio: Amount spent on meal

### Variable Types

## Types of Data

Understanding data types is crucial for choosing appropriate statistical measures.

### Qualitative (Categorical) Data

- **Nominal**: Categories with no natural order (e.g., colors, gender)
- **Ordinal**: Categories with a natural order (e.g., education levels)

### Quantitative (Numerical) Data

- **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of children)
- **Continuous**: Measurable values on a continuous scale (e.g., height, weight)

## Measures of Central Tendency

These measures identify the center or typical value of a dataset.

### Mean

mean = np.mean(data)  # 43.625
```

### Median

- **Definition**: The middle value when data is ordered
- **Formula**:
  - For odd n: Middle value
  - For even n: Average of two middle values
- **Best used**: With skewed distributions or ordinal data
- **Limitations**: Ignores actual values except middle observation(s)

```python
import numpy as np

data = [23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 89, 23, 56]
median = np.median(data)  # 39.5
```

### Mode

- **Definition**: Most frequently occurring value
- **Best used**: With categorical data or discrete numerical data
- **Limitations**: May not be unique (multimodal data)

```python
from scipy import stats

data = [23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 89, 23, 56]
mode = stats.mode(data)  # Mode: 23, Count: 2
```

### Geometric Mean

- **Definition**: nth root of the product of n values

```python
import numpy as np

data = [23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 89, 23, 56]
population_variance = np.var(data)     # Population variance
sample_variance = np.var(data, ddof=1) # Sample variance
```

### Standard Deviation

sample_std = np.std(data, ddof=1) # Sample standard deviation
```

### Coefficient of Variation

- **Definition**: Standard deviation relative to mean
- **Formula**: CV = (s/x̄) × 100%
- **Best used**: Comparing dispersion between datasets with different units

```python
import numpy as np

data = [23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 89, 23, 56]
cv = (np.std(data, ddof=1) / np.mean(data)) * 100  # CV as percentage
```

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

- **Definition**: Difference between 75th and 25th percentiles
- **Formula**: IQR = Q₃ - Q₁
