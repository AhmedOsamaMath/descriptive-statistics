# Simple Linear Regression

**Simple linear regression** is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between two continuous variables: one independent variable ($X$) and one dependent variable ($Y$). It determines how $X$ can predict or explain $Y$.

## Key Concepts

1. **Independent Variable ($X$)**:  
   The predictor or explanatory variable.  

2. **Dependent Variable ($Y$)**:  
   The response or outcome variable.  

3. **Regression Line**:  
   A line that best fits the data, showing the relationship between $X$ and $Y$.  

4. **Equation of the Regression Line**:

   $$
   Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon
   $$

   Where:

   - $Y$: Predicted value of the dependent variable  
   - $\beta_0$: Intercept (value of $Y$ when $X = 0$)  
   - $\beta_1$: Slope (change in $Y$ for a one-unit increase in $X$)  
   - $\epsilon$: Error term

## Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is linear.  
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.  
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The variance of residuals (errors) is constant across all levels of $X$.  
4. **Normality**: Residuals follow a normal distribution.

## Steps to Perform Simple Linear Regression

### Step 1: Formulate the Model

Define the dependent ($Y$) and independent ($X$) variables.

### Step 2: Collect and Explore Data

Examine the dataset for missing values, outliers, and patterns.

### Step 3: Fit the Model

Estimate the coefficients ($\beta_0, \beta_1$) using the least squares method, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals:

$$
\text{Residual} = Y_{\text{observed}} - Y_{\text{predicted}}
$$

### Step 4: Evaluate the Model

Assess the fit of the regression line using metrics like $R^2$, p-value, and standard error.

### Step 5: Interpret Results

Understand the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ based on the slope and intercept.

## Example

### Problem:

A researcher wants to study the relationship between study hours ($X$) and test scores ($Y$) for a group of students. The data is:

| Study Hours ($X$) | Test Scores ($Y$) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2                 | 50                |
| 4                 | 55                |
| 6                 | 60                |
| 8                 | 70                |
| 10                | 85                |

### Solution:

1. **Equation of Regression Line**:

   $$
   Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X
   $$

2. **Calculate Coefficients**:

   Using the least squares method:

   - Slope ($\beta_1$):

     $$
     \beta_1 = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\text{Var}(X)}
     $$

   - Intercept ($\beta_0$):

     $$
     \beta_0 = \bar{Y} - \beta_1\bar{X}
     $$

   After calculations:

   $$
   \beta_1 = 3.5, \quad \beta_0 = 46
   $$

3. **Regression Equation**:

   $$
   Y = 46 + 3.5X
   $$

4. **Predicted Values**:

   For $X = 6$:

   $$
   Y = 46 + 3.5(6) = 67
   $$

## Model Evaluation Metrics

1. **R-Squared ($R^2$)**:
   Measures the proportion of variance in $Y$ explained by $X$.  
   - Value ranges from 0 to 1.  
   - Higher values indicate a better fit.

2. **Standard Error**:  
   Represents the average distance of the observed values from the regression line.

3. **P-Value**:  
   Tests the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between $X$ and $Y$.
   - If $p \leq \alpha$ (e.g., 0.05), reject the null hypothesis.

3. **Education**:  
   Analyzing the impact of study time on academic performance.
