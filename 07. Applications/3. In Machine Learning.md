## Role of Statistics in Machine Learning

1. **Data Understanding**:  
   - Descriptive statistics summarize data distribution and relationships.  
   - Example: Mean, median, variance, correlation coefficients.

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Techniques like scaling, normalization, and dimensionality reduction are based on statistical principles.  
   - Example: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces data dimensions.

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Statistical models like linear regression, logistic regression, and Naive Bayes are widely used in ML.  
   - Probabilistic models (e.g., Bayesian networks) rely on statistical inference.

4. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and \(R^2\) are derived from statistical measures.  
   - Statistical tests assess model significance and reliability.

## Applications of Statistics in Machine Learning

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
- **Description**: Training models to predict outcomes based on labeled data.  
- **Examples**:
  - Regression: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.  
  - Classification: Identifying spam emails using word frequency.

**Statistical Techniques**:
  - Hypothesis testing for feature selection.  
  - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for linear regression.

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Description**: Discovering patterns or structures in unlabeled data.  
- **Examples**:
  - Clustering: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.  
  - Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying data without losing critical information.

**Statistical Techniques**:
  - K-means clustering relies on minimizing within-cluster variance.  
  - PCA leverages covariance matrices to identify principal components.

### 3. **Probabilistic Modeling**
- **Description**: Incorporating uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning in models.  
- **Examples**:
  - Bayesian Networks: Represent dependencies between variables.  
  - Hidden Markov Models (HMM): Used in speech recognition and time series.

**Statistical Techniques**:
  - Bayesian inference for parameter estimation.  
  - Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for incomplete data.

### 4. **Time Series Analysis**
- **Description**: Modeling and predicting sequential data.  
- **Examples**:
  - Stock price forecasting.  
  - Anomaly detection in server logs.

**Statistical Techniques**:
  - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).  
  - Exponential smoothing for trend analysis.

## Case Study: Predicting Loan Defaults

### Problem:
A bank wants to predict whether a customer will default on a loan based on features like income, credit score, and loan amount.

### Approach:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Standardize numerical features (mean = 0, variance = 1).  
   - Use descriptive statistics to handle missing data.  

2. **Model Selection**:  
   - Logistic regression to predict the binary outcome (default/no default).  

3. **Evaluation**:  
   - Confusion matrix to assess predictions.  
   - Precision and recall to balance false positives and negatives.
